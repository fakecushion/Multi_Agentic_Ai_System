# Multi-Agent AI System - Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a complete multi-agent AI system with dynamic decision making capabilities. The system can intelligently route user queries to specialized agents based on the content and context of the query.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)
- REST API with endpoints: `/ask`, `/upload_pdf`, `/logs`
- Modular architecture with separate agent implementations
- CORS support for frontend integration

### 2. Controller Agent (Decision Maker)
- Rule-based routing logic for agent selection
- Hybrid approach combining rules with LLM-based decision making
- Comprehensive logging of all decisions and interactions
- Traceability features with full request/response logging

### 3. PDF RAG Agent
- PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF
- Text chunking with configurable size and overlap
- Embedding generation with Sentence Transformers
- FAISS vector store for efficient similarity search
- Automatic processing of sample PDFs

### 4. Web Search Agent
- Real-time web search using DuckDuckGo API
- Result parsing and summarization
- Rate limit handling

### 5. ArXiv Agent
- Academic paper retrieval from ArXiv API
- Paper metadata extraction and summarization
- Recent paper discovery capabilities

### 6. Frontend
- Minimal but functional UI with:
  - Search box for questions
  - PDF upload widget
  - Results display showing answer and agents used
  - Logs viewing capability

### 7. Sample Data
- 5 NebulaByte dialog-generated PDFs for RAG demonstration
- Domain-specific content covering AI architecture discussions

### 8. Documentation
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Detailed REPORT.pdf explaining architecture and implementation
- Architecture diagrams

### 9. Deployment
- Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- Hugging Face Spaces configuration
- Environment variable handling for API keys

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up API keys in `.env` file

3. Run the application:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. Open `frontend.html` in a browser

## Testing

The system includes:
- Unit tests for agent functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Sample PDFs for RAG testing
- Log verification scripts

## Security Features

- PDF upload size limiting (10MB)
- File type validation
- No PII storage in logs
- Environment variable configuration for secrets
- Input validation and sanitization

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional LLM APIs (Groq, Google AI Studio)
- Advanced PDF processing including image/table extraction
- User feedback mechanisms for improving routing decisions
- Multi-language support
- Enhanced LLM-based decision making
