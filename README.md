# Multi_Agentic_Ai_System
The project is a Multi-Agentic AI System with Dynamic Decision Making designed to handle user queries by dynamically deciding which agents to call for an optimal response. It integrates a backend (Flask or FastAPI), a minimal frontend for search and PDF upload, and an LLM API (Groq or Google AI Studio) for orchestration and answer synthesis.
